# Localization Algorithm Verification

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

The localization algorithm has been successfully implemented according to the theoretical framework. Here's the verification of each step:

## Step 1: Represent the field as a grid ✅

**Implementation:** `_initialize_lookup_table()` method
- **Grid Resolution:** 25mm per cell (configurable)
- **Field Coverage:** 2430mm × 1820mm = 97 × 73 grid cells
- **Angle Discretization:** 16 bins (22.5° resolution)
- **Total State Space:** 97 × 73 × 16 = 113,296 possible states

```python
# Grid dimensions calculated in _initialize_lookup_table()
grid_width = int(self.field_width / self.grid_resolution)  # 97 cells
grid_height = int(self.field_height / self.grid_resolution)  # 73 cells
angle_step = 2 * math.pi / self.angle_resolution  # 16 angle bins
```

## Step 2: Precompute expected sensor readings ✅

**Implementation:** `_initialize_lookup_table()` method
- **Ray Casting:** Uses `_cast_ray()` to compute expected distances to walls
- **Lookup Table:** Precomputed for all (x, y, θ) combinations
- **Storage:** Efficient dictionary lookup by grid indices
- **Performance:** One-time computation, fast runtime lookups

```python
# Precomputation for each grid cell and orientation
for x_idx in range(grid_width):
    for y_idx in range(grid_height):
        for angle_idx in range(self.angle_resolution):
            # Cast rays for all 8 sensor angles
            expected_readings = {}
            for sensor in self.tof_manager.sensors:
                world_angle = angle + sensor.angle
                dist = self._cast_ray([x, y], world_angle)
                expected_readings[sensor.angle] = dist
```

## Step 3: Take actual sensor readings ✅

**Implementation:** `localize()` method
- **Sensor Update:** `self.tof_manager.update_distances()`
- **8 TOF Sensors:** Covering all directions around robot
- **Real-time Data:** Continuous sensor reading updates
- **Validation:** Checks for minimum 3 valid sensors

```python
# Update TOF sensor readings with real sensor data
self.tof_manager.update_distances()

# Count valid measurements
valid_measurements = 0
for sensor in self.tof_manager.sensors:
    distance = self.tof_manager.sensor_distances[sensor.angle]
    if self.min_distance <= distance <= self.max_distance:
        valid_measurements += 1
```

## Step 4: Compare actual vs expected readings ✅

**Implementation:** `_compute_error()` method
- **Error Function:** Weighted sum of squared differences
- **Weighting:** Closer measurements weighted more heavily
- **Normalization:** Error normalized by number of valid sensors
- **Robustness:** Handles invalid sensor readings gracefully

```python
# Error computation with weighting
for sensor in self.tof_manager.sensors:
    actual_distance = self.tof_manager.sensor_distances[sensor.angle]
    expected_distance = expected_readings[sensor.angle]
    
    if self.min_distance <= actual_distance <= self.max_distance:
        diff = abs(expected_distance - actual_distance)
        weight = 1.0 / (1.0 + actual_distance / 1000.0)
        error += weight * diff * diff
```

## Step 5: Iterative refinement (search algorithm) ✅

**Implementation:** `_optimize_position()` method
- **Multi-Resolution Search:** Coarse-to-fine grid refinement
- **Iterative Refinement:** Reduces resolution progressively
- **Convergence:** Prevents infinite loops with max iterations
- **Global Search:** `_global_grid_search()` for initialization

```python
# Multi-resolution iterative grid search
current_resolution = self.grid_resolution * 4  # Start coarse
while current_resolution >= self.grid_resolution:
    # Search around current best guess
    search_range = int(current_resolution / self.grid_resolution)
    # ... search logic ...
    current_resolution = int(current_resolution * decay_rate)  # Refine
```

## Step 6: Output the best position estimate ✅

**Implementation:** `localize()` method
- **Position Estimate:** Best (x*, y*, θ*) with minimum error
- **Confidence:** Based on error magnitude and validation
- **Validation:** `validate_localization()` checks consistency
- **Smoothing:** Maintains state between iterations

```python
# Output best position estimate
position, error = self._optimize_position(self.angle)

# Calculate confidence
max_expected_error = 2000.0
normalized_error = min(error / max_expected_error, 1.0)
confidence = 1.0 - normalized_error

# Validate result
is_valid = self.validate_localization(position, self.angle)
```
